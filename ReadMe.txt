You'll be safe here - Rico Blanco

â–º Official Lyrics:
Nobody knows just why we're here
Could it be fate or random circumstance?
At the right place, at the right time
Two roads intertwine
And if the universe conspired
To meld our lives to make us fuel and fire
Then know wherever you will be
So too, shall I be

Close your eyes, dry your tears
'Cause when nothing seems clear
You'll be safe here 
From the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Weary heart 
You'll be safe here

Remember how we laughed until we cried
At the most stupid things like
We were so high?
But love was all that we were on, we belong
And though the world would never understand
This unlikely union and why it still stands
Someday we will be set free
Pray and believe

When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you
You'll be safe 

Save your eyes from your tears
When everything's unclear
You'll be safe here 
From the sheer weight of your doubts and fears 
Wounded heart

When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you 
You'll be safe here

In my arms 
Through the long, cold night sleep tight
You'll be safe here
When no one understands
I'll believe
You'll be safe
You'll be safe
You'll be safe here

Put your heart in my hands
You'll be safe here
